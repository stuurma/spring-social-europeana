## Contributing to this project
As this is an Open Source project, all contributions/suggestions are welcome.
You can contribute in several ways.

### Report bugs/suggestions
Use the Issues functionality on 
[our GitHub page](https://github.com/eLedge/spring-social-europeana) to add bug reports

hardware, android version, screen size etc etc.

### Contribute code
* __Get a fork__: The easiest way is to create a fork of our project, make 
your changes and submit a pull request. Some of the core developers will 
look at your request and hopefully merge it into the master branch.

* __Join the team__: It's also possible to be added to the development team 
and submit directly into the repository. But it would be nice if we know you 
a bit, so use the fork method first a few times. :-)
